# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

- The purpose of the project was to take starter code and modify it to create a working application that takes inputs of employee names and salaries and displays them in a table.
- The application prompts the user to input the name and salary information for each employee, and then asks if additional an additional employee should be added. Once the user chooses not to add additional employees, the table is displayed with all employee data. 
- Additionally, the console log displays the average salary of all employees that were input, and also chooses and displays one of the input employee names at random. 
- This was a helpful project because I was given the chance to inspect a large amount of well-written functions and digest how they were organized, then given the chance to work my way through writing my own combination of functions and arrays. I needed to look up how to use several elements, such as while loops and Math.random.
